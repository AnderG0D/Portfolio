After initiating the search, the app displays the results in a leaderboard, ranking influencers by their confidence score, from highest to lowest. Clicking on any influencer takes the user to a detailed page showing all their claims, whether they were verified, debunked, etc., along with the corresponding links to the claims and the trusted sources (scientific journals, health websites, etc.) used to verify or dispute those claims.",
